# About
A terminal-based analytics and visualization tool inspired by spreadsheet interfaces like Excel, optimized for developers and data scientists.  Displays columns of a pandas DataFrame directly in the terminal using the Curses library, with fast navigation, shortcut keys, and instant refresh.  

Integrates with experiment pipelines by passing variable configurations to external programs, collecting CSV outputs, and visualizing results with matplotlib to analyze parameter effects and performance trends.
